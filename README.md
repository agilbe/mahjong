# Mahjong

Project to make an easy to use mahjong scoring tool.

## Goals

- Application should be usable on mobile
- Winning hand recognition should be fast
    - Performant
    - Fast to use (OCR?)
- Score Keeping is required
    - Account for a full round
    - Multiple save files
    - Graphing player stats

## Technologies

- NVM (Node Version Manager)
- Node JS
- Javascript
- React?

## Data Storage

- Initially intended to be FE focused with small BE requirements. Firebase is a good starting point
for storing data although securing it will be a little annoying.
    - Use local storage first and make sure the interface is extensible.
